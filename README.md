# HTML-Document-Clustering---Basic-Information-Retrieval

HTML documents were clustered using this basic project. The documents were clustered based on a similarity cosine metric used commonly in information retrieval. This metric is used to generate a similarity matrix that can be used to cluster documents based on their similarity level. An executable jar file is provided that follows the format: 

java -jar HW5.jar [input directory of HTML files] [output directory for results]

The program is written in Java, and the program calculates the similarity matrix, then clusters documents accordingly and provides the final clusters as the output.
